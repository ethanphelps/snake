# snake
This is a snake implementation I'm making for fun to get experience with Typescript, Web Components and HTML Canvas. It's built using Lit Element web components and has a simple typescript game "engine" that runs and draws the game onto the HTML Canvas.

To install and run the game, copy the repo url, git clone it, and then run the following in your terminal:
```
cd snake && npm install
```
and then
```
npm run start
```
This should open up a browser window on localhost:3000. Use WASD or the arrow keys to control the snake. Try to eat as much food as possible and don't hit yourself or the walls!
